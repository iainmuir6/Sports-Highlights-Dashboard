# Sports Highlights Dashboard

One of three dashboards that make up the [Morning Scoop repository](https://github.com/iainmuir6/MorningScoop-Sports-News-Fantasy). Compiles and displays box scores, as well as YouTube highlights, for all major sports leagues around the world. On its own, the program uses Google Forms to allow the user to select their favorite leagues and teams (creating a curated list of highlights).
